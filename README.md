# SC-XW1
CMU/Swiftceipt Collaborative Project.

Currently the `fiddling` directory is used to make sure that we can do certain proofs of concept on a very basic level.
	
- `endpoints.html` demonstrates that we can hit the endpoints quickly and show the appropriate message
- `login_api_call.js` demonstrates using SwiftCeipt's login api to authenticate a user in Node.js.
- `get_receipts.js` demonstrates usage of the [`request`](https://github.com/request/request) module from npm.
